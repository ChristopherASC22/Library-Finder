    The Facts:
  </h1>
    
    <div>        
    <ul>
      <li>More than 43 million adults in the United States cannot read, write, or do basic math above a third-grade level.</li>
      <li>A rise of just 1% in literacy scores leads to a 2.5% rise in labor productivity and a 1.5% rise in GDP</li>
      <li>If all adults could reach the equivalent of a sixth-grade reading level, up to $2.2 trillion additional income could be generated annually for the United States</li>
      <li>An estimated $106 – $238 billion in health care costs every year are linked to low adult literacy skills</li>
      <li>When people who are in prison participate in education programs, they are 43% less likely to re-offend, compared to people who do not participate</li>
      <li>Only 25% of students in California schools can perform basic reading skills.</li>
      <li>Three out of four people on welfare can’t read.</li>    
      <li>In 1990 “The Guinness World Record Book” recognized Howard Berg for his ability to read more than 25,000 words per minute. However, this is exceptional. A normal reading rate for learning is considered 100-200 words per minute, and for comprehension, it is 200-400 wpm. Speed readers normally read at a rate of up to 700 wpm.But it is a fact that geniuses read much faster than most people. Napoleon, for example, read at a rate of 2,000 words per minute, while the French novelist, Balzac, could read a small novel in just about 30 minutes!</li>    
      <li>Nearly 85% of the juveniles who face trial in the juvenile court system are functionally illiterate, proving that there is a close relationship between illiteracy and crime. More than 60% of all inmates are functionally illiterate.</li>
      <li>'Bibliosma' is the word for loving the way books smell.</li>
      <li>The most expensive book ever purchased was bought by Bill Gates for $30.8 million - it was The Codex Leicester by Leonardo Da Vinci, and had been written in 1510.</li>
      <li>Researchers at the University of Sussex found reading for just six minutes may reduce stress by up to 68%</li>
      <li>It's been found that reading enhances our attention spans: the structure of stories helps kids' brains process things in sequence, which holds their attention for longer and enables clear thinking.</li>
      <li>The University of California has found that people having a ninth-grade (or higher) literacy level, have 4 to 5 times more chances not to suffer mental declines as they age.</li>
      <li>Children who read 3,000 words each day take top 2% positions in standardized tests. So, if you want your children to have a productive life and successful career, you need to introduce them to reading.</li>
      <li>Proficient readers usually have better paid jobs. They are 2.5 times more likely to earn $1,000 or more a week. </li>
      <li>The world’s tallest book, “Collection of Maritime Rules”, is stored in the Amsterdam Museum. Its height is about 6.4 feet, and it’s over 3 feet wide.</li>
      <li>Well, if you enjoy reading and are deeply concerned about your vision, take speed-reading courses. This skill helps to preserve vision and doubles your recall speed</li>
      <li>Some states determine how many prison beds will be needed in future years in part on how well current elementary students are performing on reading tests.</li>
